<h3>kicking ass and pvp have never been so gei</h3>

<h4>Goal of the Game</h4>
<p>DPZones is a zone-control type of game. There are classes you can play as to help your team capture as many zones as possible. As long as you own a zone then your team is getting points, and you want to have as many points as possible in case time runs out. The team with the higher amount of points or whichever team reaches the cap first wins the game.</p>
=======
<h4>Dynamic Spawning</h4>
<p>When the game starts, all the players are randomly spawned on top of any solid block with 5 blocks of air above them. Whenever a player dies they are respawned in a 20 block radius outside any of their captured or neutral zones. Your team can also win the game if all the zones are captured and all the oposing team's players are dead.<br><i>If the spawning system gets too complicated, we can just place bedrock all around the map, and it would appear invisible during gameplay. The bedrock would be the spawning points.</i></p>
=======
<h4>Capturing Zones</h4>
<p>You stand on a zone to capture it. Whichever team has more players on a zone gets to capture it, and the higher the amount of players a team has on a zone, the faster it'll get capped.</p>
=======
<h4>Teams</h4>
<p>There will be two teams: Red and Blue, but support for more than one team depending on the player count will be added later in the Beta stages.</p>
=======
<h4>Classes</h4>
<p>There will be 4 free classes that will be released with DPZones 0.1.0. Scout, Kinetic, Warrior, and Marskman will be the first four released classes.
